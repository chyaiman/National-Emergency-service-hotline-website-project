# 🚨 National Service Emergency Hotline  

A web application designed to centralize **Bangladesh’s national emergency helplines** (Police, Fire Service, Ambulance, Anti-Corruption, Women & Child Helpline, etc.) into one interactive, user-friendly interface.  

## ✨ Features  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and JavaScript**  
- ❤️ **Favorite counter** – Users can “like” services with a heart button  
- 📋 **Copy-to-clipboard** – Instantly copy helpline numbers  
- 📞 **Call simulation** – Deducts coins when making a simulated call, displays service info  
- 📑 **Call history** – Tracks past calls with service name, number, and timestamp  
- 🗑️ **Clear history option** – Reset call history easily  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind + DaisyUI), JavaScript  
- **Icons & Assets:** FontAwesome, custom PNGs  

## 🎮 How It Works  
1. Users start with **100 coins**.  
2. Every **call costs 20 coins**. If coins run out, users cannot make a call.  
3. **Copy buttons** allow users to copy helpline numbers to clipboard.  
4. **History section** records calls and can be cleared anytime.
